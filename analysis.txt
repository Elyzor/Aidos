Hello,

As part of a University project I had to find and analyze an open source project and I chose to analyze this one as it fascinated me,
because it is beginner friendly and also it is about Bomberman.

I analyzed the project through the IntelliJ plugin CodeMR and I found that the project is well structured, as there were no issued
regarding the complexity, the lack of cohesion, the coupling or the size of the classes. Despite the fact that this project is well
structured, I noticed that there are little to none comments in the different sections of the program and I wanted to point that out
so maybe it can be fixed in future updates.

Thank you.
